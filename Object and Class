object ->object is a real world entity.
Ex:

Laptop is a real world entity
object have properties

state->variable(fixed)
behaviour->function/methods(Runt time based)

Laptop->
state-->name,color[dell,black]
behaviour->audio,vedio,services(Run time based)24*7

...............................
Bank application[Real world entity]

state->name,branch,location,starting date

behaviour->receiption,accountant,  etc...

Bank->drawing (structure ) class.
...................................

class is a blue print of a real world entity.

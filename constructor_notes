functions:
function is like a separate task,inside a class we can create lots of separate task,by the help of function name.
and these types of functions are call by object.

class <class-name>
{
   function-name()
   {
     block of code;
   }
}

var object=new <class-name>(); 
object.function-name();
....................................

constructor is also a funtion,but special type of function,this function is automatically call when we create the object.

constructor is create by constructor keyword.
